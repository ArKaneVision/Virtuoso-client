## My organizational strategy and process

I built my game in a 4 day period, I approached the problem by breaking it up into steps.
First I made my [wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/UPHLJu) and [user stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wudfHGWM7rPGWo77dNYKamerVRqQxQKFvquoIPEU17Q/edit)
in order to understand what I wanted the final product. The next step for me was building the game logic. Further breaking things into steps I used an array to represent the game board in JavaScript. building up the logic functionally. After tackling that I moved into my authorization methods built using Ajax and Jquery to communicate to an API that was already built. Finally I built the stylized the page using css and sass.

My over all strategy to keep things moving was to focus on what I knew I could complete first and continue working on that one piece until I was finished without jumping around. By doing this I could make sure I was building off of working componentes. The pieces that worked well could further guide my programming decisions

### Some problems left to solve

* I want to build a simple AI to play against. I started building the logic in the game-events-ai.js file
but it is still very buggy and is not deployed in the current version
* I want to add confetti on game win
* I want to add background music that I composed to complete the 90s site look and feel

Things to add:
  Metranome
  show total time spend practices certain instrument
  or total practice time on a day
  show calender with all days practiced
  add exercise to practices (Practices have_many Exercises)
  progress bar to master
  update and delete button on each practice
  update does not create new values if nothing is entered
  make boxes with bootstrap containers styled like old black on green moniters
  have search funtion for certain dates, instruments, start time, or duration
